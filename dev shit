// fully rewrote the structure to make it easier to understand and to work with, this was cancer

// ---------later problems(seems like too much work rn)---------

// sell duplicates,auto sell under x rarity,bulk sell(as in 1,10,all change with btn)   --added
// upgrades
// ig very easy to edit saves but like I dont really care lol
// add money per min
// inv filter options
// sounds?
// add modifiers (blur, colourchange,etc) that gives times X of value
// rare cold coin cookie clicker ahh gold cookie
// pity system? genshin impact ahh idea 
// ------------mobile stuff------------
// vibrate on rare pulls (with toggle somwhere ig options menu)
// allow button to be hold for like 8cps 


// ---Upgrade Ideas--
// multi spin (probably not gonna add but idk)
// more cash per click 
// faster spin
// better odds? (maybe jsut new case tbh)
// passive income (player hires ppl to spin (no actual cost for player) can upgrade what they can get, start of with max purple)
//unlock case queue for afking also with this auto spin 
// crit hits, and then also  damage upgrades and crit % upgrades
// upgradeable chance to double the drop, up to like 10%?
